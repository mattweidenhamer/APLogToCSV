# Convert Archipelago Log to CSV.

A tool to convert the output files from Archipelago into CSV files for use in data analysis. Just for fun!

How to use:
1. Put your file into the input folder.
2. Answer the command prompts.

Future plans:
* Make easier to automate by adding a "use defaults" option.
* Add an additional column for item lookups based on their type. Would require an item CSV from the archipelago world.
